<p id=zoe-pic-text>(This is Zoe laying on her back and enjoying herself, this is her nightly and sometimes daily routine!)</p>
<p>As you can see in the above picture above, this is Zoe my chocolate lab who is laying on her back enjoying herself! This is her daily routine,
  but she mostly does this at night. My family has always emphasized adopting pets who have no home or who have been abandoned. Therefore, we
  went out for a few weeks looking for a dog from the animal shelter to adopt and we ended up meeting Zoe! Her owners before her lost their home
  and was living out of their car with the dog. Being unable to feed her any longer they gave her up to the animal shelter, we were lucky enough
  to have visited in that point of time to get her. She has been nothing short of the best dog that I have ever had!

<h1 class="headings">What do most people say about a Chocolate Lab?</h1>

    alt="DogSittingWithTongueHangingOut">
<p>Throughout my life I have often heard people constantly say that if you don’t know what type of dog to get for your family then,
  ‘get a lab’. I never understood why people talked so highly of them until I had one of my own and with good reason. They have a
  reputation for being great with kids, obedient, trainable (very smart), healthy, have unique personalities (each one is a little
  different), and great for the outdoors!

<p>There are many different takes on where a Labrador retriever has originated from. Popular opinions believe they originally came from
  Newfoundland in the 1500’s. Golden Labrador’s and chocolate Labrador Retrievers were primarily used for to jump into the icy
  water in order to bring back fish that got off the fishing hook. Imagine that! If you ever wondered why your lab is obsessed with fetching
  balls in the water it is because they were originally bred to catch fetch fish in the water!

  Apart from fishing they also were also primarily used for shooting sports and recognized by the greatest sportsman in that era (and many today) who hunted
  for wild game, primarily because of a labs amazing work ethic and intelligence in day to day activities, specifically for farmers and outdoorsman (hunters).
  As time went on lab’s became more and more notorious as one of if not the ultimate game dogs for those who enjoy the outdoors.

<p>Out of all the dog breeds golden labs and chocolate labs rank as one of the best family dogs to have, specifically for those with
  children. According to the <a href="https://www.akc.org/dog-breeds/labrador-retriever">'American Kennel Club'</a>, Labrador Retrievers ranked as the Number
  #1 dog from 2013 all the way to 2017. The reason being is because they are considered extremely friendly and also considered to be one of the
  best ‘companion’ dogs to have. They are known to create bonds with the entire family (especially kids) and get along extremely well with other
  dogs. My dog Zoe for example tries, to play with just about every dog and kid she meets!

<p>For individuals who are out-going, Labrador retrievers are extremely active and require lots of exercise and playtime. They are
    known to help wear out your kids and remain extremely active throughout most of the day. They are extremely inquisitive and try to
    be a part of whatever you do!
  	For those with young kids such as newborns and/or toddlers, labs have an inner instinct to be extremely gentle and protective of the young.
    When I wrestle with my son or daughter, my dog has been known to jump in front of them in order to ‘protect them’. When this
    happens, I start to wrestle with my dog instead of my son, he loves to watch me wrestle with my dog!

<h1 class="headings">Who should and should not have a Labrador retriever?</h1>
<img id="ZoeLickingTheo" src="Images\ZoeLickingTheo.jpg"
    alt="Zoe (My lab) Playfulling Licking a Kid">
<p>Individuals who are not active and want a dog who just lays around the house and is ok with not going outside should never own a lab.
    These dogs require high amounts of physical and mental exercise in playing games, chasing your kids, and/or playing with other dog breeds.
    Not exercising your lab in my opinion would be considered a type of dog abuse.

    They are more suited for individuals who are outgoing and active, specifically those who enjoy the outdoors. However, if you are not the
    type of person who likes to go into the mountains all the time just taking your lab to the dog park at least every other day (preferably
    every day) is good enough. Having a fenced yard with a doggy door is always extremely beneficial and having kids who enjoy playing with your
    lab is an extremely good choice for having this type of dog breed.

<h1 class="headings">How to keep your Chocolate or Golden lab healthy, take them to a dog park regularly (Add pic Below)!</h1>
<p>Most cities nowadays have a dog park where you can unleash your dog and let them play. Many dog breeds require an individual to train
    their dogs to ‘get along’ with other breeds. However, for chocolate Labrador and golden Labrador Retreivers this is not the case. From the get-go
    they will get excited and anxious to run circles around other dog breeds and playfully wrestle and talk (with dog sounds). Exercise is by far the most important variable
    in keeping your lab healthy. However, feeding your dog a high quality dog food such as <a href="https://www.tasteofthewildpetfood.com">
    Taste of the Wild</a> for example will also go a long ways in keeping your dog healthy.
<p>However, because of the many diverse dog breeds (and cross breeding) which may or may not include your labs (If it is not pure bred) may require you to test out
    a few different types of dog foods to ensure the right composition for their genetic make-up. My dog Zoe was on the <a href="https://www.tasteofthewildpetfood.com">
    ‘Taste of the Wild’</a> dog food which from my experience from selling dog-food as my jobfor a period of time at a local farming store was hands down the highest
     quality food that one could get. However, it was not the best for my dog. Zoe became sluggish and started having health issues such as dog diarrhea,
     and dog constipation, making weird dog sounds. We also watched our dog eating grass daily.... Every day!
</p>
<p>We switched her over to a different kind of dog food called <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Purina-Pro-Plan-Shredded-Chicken/dp/B001QCKS4O/ref=sr_1_4?keywords=Purina+Pro+Plan&qid=1566734418&s=gateway&sr=8-4">
    Purina Pro Plan SAVOR</a> days. The dog diarrhea, dog constipation, weird dog sounds, and having to watch our dog eat grass every day all went away.
    I am in no way advocating or suggesting that Labrador retrievers should eat Purina Pro Plan SAVOR over Taste of the Wild, on the contrary I would
    recommend trying taste of the wild first. However, pay close attention to how your dog reacts and adjust accordingly. Mine for some reason required a different
    type of dog food.

<h1 class="headings">Best Toys for Golden and Chocolate Labs (Add pic Below)</h1>
<p>Any toy really is good enough for a labrador retriever. However, my favorite has been a <a href="https://www.amazon.com/AMZpets-Toys-Aggressive-Chewers-Large/dp/B07MKZ464S/ref=sr_1_1_sspa?keywords=dog+toys&qid=1566734768&s=gateway&sr=8-1-spons&psc=1&spLa=ZW5jcnlwdGVkUXVhbGlmaWVyPUFXMUk1NlEyUjdFQSZlbmNyeXB0ZWRJZD1BMDM3MDMxNjFUVk5PUjZVQ0tOVU8mZW5jcnlwdGVkQWRJZD1BMDg5MDEyNDMxTEcwSjVPM0xYNVYmd2lkZ2V0TmFtZT1zcF9hdGYmYWN0aW9uPWNsaWNrUmVkaXJlY3QmZG9Ob3RMb2dDbGljaz10cnVl">
    Sturdy Rope Toy</a>. Labs love to chew, therefore you will want to get a toy that will not break down fast and last a while longer. More Examples of study toys are
</a href="https://www.amazon.com/KONG-UB1-Extreme-Medium-Large/dp/B004VBC0SY/ref=sr_1_45?keywords=tough+dog+toys&qid=1566734901&s=gateway&sr=8-45">
    Kong Rubber Balls</a>, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/KONG-Classic-Durable-Natural-Rubber/dp/B0002AR0I8/ref=sr_1_4?keywords=kong+dog+toys&qid=1566734989&s=gateway&sr=8-4">
    Kong-Classic Dog Toy</a>, or even a <a href="https://www.amazon.com/KONG-KM2-Ring-Small-Med/dp/B073SZNNRT/ref=sr_1_26?keywords=kong+dog+toys&qid=1566734989&s=gateway&sr=8-26">
    Kong KM2 Ring Toy</a>. However, you definitely cannot go wrong with just a tennis ball. You can buy a pack of 45 <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Tourna-Pressureless-Tennis-Balls-Vinyl/dp/B00KNMAZBE/ref=sr_1_18?keywords=dog+tennis+ball&qid=1566735109&s=gateway&sr=8-18">
    Tennis Balls</a> which comes out to around 78 cents each. Fourty-five tennis balls should be enough for your life-time. If you do not wish to buy a pack
    in bulk you can easily purchase one from your local store such as Big-Five, WalMart, or other sporting good stores.
